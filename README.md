# Fantasy Football League

## Description
A website that allows you to make a fantasy football team of your choosing.
They will be displayed in a False-9 formation. Any additional players will be automatically added to the substitution page.

### How It Works

- New Users will create an account. 
- Existing Users can log-in to create/edit their team.
- Each position will have a player picture that, when clicked, will pull up a player card with picture, player stats, and an update/delete button.
- Users will be able to create new players on that get put on the substitute page. If they choose to put new players as one of the starting XI, then they will edit the players there.
- The "Delete" function will wipe the information on the Starting XI card, or will eleminate the card from the subsitite page.
